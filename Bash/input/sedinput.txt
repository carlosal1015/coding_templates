This is some useless file to be used with the sed.sh script.
It contains no real information.



This is a line that contains the keyword print, 
but doesn't start with it.

print "a[1]", a[1]
print "a[:,1]", a[:,1]
print "a[-1]", a[-1]
print "a[:,-1]", a[:,-1]


print ""
print ""
print "Initiating Arrays"
print ""
print "np.zeros((2,3))"
print np.zeros((2,3))
