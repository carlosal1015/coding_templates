### What is this repository for? ###

This repository contains templates for various coding languages, how-to's and a bit of other stuff like algorithms.

So far, it contains some templates for:

-   Algorithms (miscellaneous algorithms in various languages, mainly to demonstrate how they work)
-   Bash
- 	C, C++
-   Fortran
-   html
-   LaTeX
-   Python 2 and 3 (although python 2 won't be updated anymore)



Others might be added as soon as I need to learn them :)


### How do I get set up? ###

-   No setup needed. You just need to be able to run bash, python or to compile the programs written in C, C++, Fortran or LaTeX.

### Contribution guidelines ###

-   No contributions from other people are planned. But you do what you gotta do.
