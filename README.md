### What is this repository for? ###

This repository contains templates for various coding languages.
So far, it contains some templates for:

-   Bash
-   Fortran
-   Python
-   LaTeX

In the near future, probably Java, C and C++ will join the ranks as well as new templates to the already existing languages.

### How do I get set up? ###

-   No setup needed. You just need to be able to run bash, python and to compile fortran programs. 

### Contribution guidelines ###

-   No contributions from other people are planned. If you want to contribute, contact me. (Why the fuck would anyone want that.)
