==================
NOTES ON C++
==================



==================
COMPILING
==================

FLAGS
    -std=c++11
        choose C++ standard (library). There are various standards to choose from.




==================
INPUT/OUTPUT
==================
New Line
    two options: either use \n or << endl.
    endl causes the buffer to flush, so to write
    everything that hasn't been written yet to file.
    \n does not.



==================
VARIABLES
==================
Variable names
    The variable names are case sensitive.

Variable declaration
    Doesn't need to be in the beginning of a function.
    You apparently can define new variables anytime.

Strings
    Strings are compound types. (As opposed to fundamental types.)


Literal constants in other bases
    C++ allows the use of octal numbers (base 8) and hexadecimal numbers (base 16) as literal constants. For octal literals, the digits are preceded with a 0 (zero) character. And for hexadecimal, they are preceded by the characters 0x (zero, x). For example, the following literal constants are all equivalent to each other:

    75         // decimal
    0113       // octal
    0x4b       // hexadecimal  


Increment and Decrement (++, --)
    x++ : first evaluate expression, then increment x
    ++x : first increment x, then evaluate expression
    Example 1: x = 3; y = ++x; // x contains 4, y contains 4
    Example 2: x = 3; y = x++; // x contains 4, y contains 3
