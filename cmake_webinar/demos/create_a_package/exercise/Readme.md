# Exercise : Create a package
The directory `hello_world_mpi` contains a simple MPI hello world example as well as a `CMakeLists.txt` file. However, the later does not contain any target definition.
Define a target that successfully builds the `hello.f90` source code. Note that you will need to link to the MPI library in order to create and run the executable.
