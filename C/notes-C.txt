LIBRARIES
===========


#include <stdio.h>      /* input, output    */
#include <math.h>       /* math library     */



#include <limits.h>     /* limits of data types */


NOTES
===========

#define NAME value 
    Preprocessing directive: Replaces all instances of NAME with value.

Variable names are case sensitive.

Declarations don't need to be at the beginning of a function, they can be
everywhere in the code.

char assignment:
    needs apostrophe ',quote marks " don't work

booleans:
    There are no custom built-in boolean types. Use int instead. (There is
    however a <stdbool.h> in C99...)
    This works: int i = 1; then !i = 0; !(!i) = 1
    REMEMBER: true = 1; false = 0
