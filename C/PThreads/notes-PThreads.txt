Compilation:
    with -pthread flag for gcc


Concurrency:
    environments in which the tasks we define can occur in any order

Parallelism:
    simultaneous execution of concurrent tasks on different processors.
    All parallel programming is concurrent, but not all concurrent programmin is parallel.

The Pthreads standard specifies concurrency, parallelism is the option of system implementors. => Portability: Pthreads code can run on both multiprocessors and uniprocessors.

By default, all threads share the resources of the process in which they exist. Independent processes share nothing
