# README python3 #

Contains python-howto's.

Some directory contents explained:

- applications:
	short (and long) how-to's for specific tasks
	
- deprecated:
	basic python stuff. The content has been moved to jupyter notebooks, hence deprecated.
	I still keep in in case I need to copypaste something quickly, or if I don't have jupyter on the
	machine where I'm trying to look at it.
	
- html
	Exported jupyter notebooks using the convert_ipynb_to_html.sh
	
- inputfiles
	Input files for the scripts and notebooks
	
- make_a_package
	How to make a python package that can be installed with pip
	
- plots
	matplotlib stuff
	
- sphinx
	basic sphinx stuff
